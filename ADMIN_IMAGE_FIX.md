# Admin Dashboard Image Loading Fix

## The Problem
The admin dashboard at `https://tedara.com/admin/` was not loading the authentication illustration image (`crowd.png`) because the asset paths were incorrect for the path-based routing setup.

## Root Cause
The admin dashboard was looking for images at `/assets/images/crowd.png` but with path-based routing, it should be looking at `/admin/assets/images/crowd.png`.

## The Solution
Updated the admin dashboard's Vite configuration to use the correct base path.

### What I Fixed:

1. **✅ Updated `frontend/vite.config.ts`**
   - Changed `base: './'` to `base: '/admin/'`
   - This ensures all asset paths are prefixed with `/admin/`

2. **✅ Rebuilt Admin Dashboard**
   - Generated new build with correct asset paths
   - All assets now reference `/admin/assets/...`

3. **✅ Updated Combined Build**
   - Combined the fixed admin build with storefront
   - Ready for deployment

## Asset Path Changes

### Before (Broken):
```html
<img src="/assets/images/crowd.png" alt="Authentication illustration">
```

### After (Fixed):
```html
<img src="/admin/assets/images/crowd.png" alt="Authentication illustration">
```

## Files Updated:
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` - Set base path to `/admin/`
- `dist/admin/index.html` - Now has correct asset paths
- `dist/admin/assets/` - All assets properly referenced

## Deployment Steps:

1. **Deploy the updated build to Netlify**
2. **Test the admin dashboard**: `https://tedara.com/admin/`
3. **Verify the authentication illustration loads correctly**

## Expected Results:
- ✅ **Authentication illustration displays** on the admin login page
- ✅ **All admin assets load correctly** (CSS, JS, images)
- ✅ **Admin dashboard functions properly** with correct styling

## Current Status:
- ✅ **Code fixed** - Vite configuration updated
- ✅ **Build updated** - New build with correct asset paths
- ⏳ **Deployment needed** - Updated build needs to be deployed

**Next step: Deploy the updated build to fix the image loading issue!**
