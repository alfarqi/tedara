# Admin Dashboard Image Loading Fix

## The Problem
The admin dashboard at `https://tedara.com/admin/` was not loading images because:
- Admin dashboard is served from `/admin` path
- Images were referenced with root-relative paths (`/assets/images/crowd.png`)
- But the actual images are located at `/admin/assets/images/crowd.png`

## The Solution
Updated the frontend Vite configuration to use the correct base path for the admin dashboard.

### What I Fixed:

1. **✅ Updated `frontend/vite.config.ts`**
   - Changed `base: './'` to `base: '/admin/'`
   - This ensures all asset paths are prefixed with `/admin/`

2. **✅ Rebuilt Admin Dashboard**
   - Generated new build with correct asset paths
   - All images now reference `/admin/assets/images/...`

3. **✅ Updated Combined Build**
   - Combined the updated admin build with storefront

### Asset Paths Now Correct:
- **Before**: `/assets/images/crowd.png` ❌
- **After**: `/admin/assets/images/crowd.png` ✅

### Files Updated:
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` - Set base path to `/admin/`
- `dist/admin/index.html` - Now has correct asset references
- `dist/admin/assets/` - All assets properly located

## Deployment Status
- ✅ **Code fixed** - Vite configuration updated
- ✅ **Build updated** - New build with correct paths
- ⏳ **Deployment needed** - Updated build needs to be deployed

## Next Steps
Deploy the updated build to Netlify:

**Option 1: Automatic (if connected to Git):**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix admin dashboard asset paths for /admin base path"
git push
```

**Option 2: Manual Deployment:**
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Go to "Deploys" tab  
3. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
4. Or drag and drop the `dist` folder

## Expected Results After Deployment
- ✅ **Images load correctly** in admin dashboard
- ✅ **Authentication illustration** displays properly
- ✅ **All admin assets** (CSS, JS, images) load from correct paths
- ✅ **Admin dashboard fully functional** at `https://tedara.com/admin/`

## Verification
After deployment, check:
1. Visit `https://tedara.com/admin/`
2. Verify the "Authentication illustration" image loads
3. Check browser Network tab - all assets should load from `/admin/assets/...`
4. No 404 errors for images or other assets

**The fix is ready! Deploy the updated build to resolve the image loading issue.**
